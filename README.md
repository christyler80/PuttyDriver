# Putty Driver
PuttyDriver evaluates a Microsoft Windows automation and robotics interface with Linux and Unix hosted non-GUI systems, via the popular open source PuTTY SSH and Telnet client developed by Simon Tatham and others. 

PuttyDriver aims to i) help integrate legacy applications within modern digital systems, ii) assist systems administration and iii) automate legacy application testing (e.g., regression testing) via an easy to use interface.

PuTTY screens and input commands are captured automatically and can optionally be saved to a SQL database using the schemas provided. An example SQLite database is included for testing.

Scripts can be developed and tested interactively using Micrososft Excel and once tested, scheduled to run automatically using the accompanying version of PuTTY (putty.exe).

PuTTY command line text and application screens text, together with PuTTY cursor position are used to control the timing and execution of script instructions.

.NET controller programs are under development and scheduled for Q2 2025.
