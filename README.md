# Excel Putty Driver
PuttyDriver evaluates a Microsoft Windows application automation and robotics interface with the popular open source PuTTY SSH and Telnet client developed by Simon Tatham and others. 

PuttyDriver aims to assist systems administration and legacy application testing (e.g., regression testing) via an easy to use automation and robotics Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) interface.

Planned future versions of PuttyDriver, include .NET controller programs (Visual Basic and C#) for integration of legacy applications with modern digital systems.
